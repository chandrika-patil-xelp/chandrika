                            <div class="tCont fLeft">Gold found in nature is in its purest form or also referred as 24 karat gold, pure gold is too soft to make jewellery and hence as a common practice is mixed with other metallic elements such as copper and zinc to form an alloy that is considerably stronger without sacrificing too much of its lustre. The popular Karat weights and their pure gold percentages are as listed below:</div>
                            <div class="fLeft points">24 karat: 100% gold or Pure gold</div>

                            <div class="fLeft points">Due to physical properties of a diamond and other gemstones, they can only be set in 18 Karat or lower purity of gold as anything above 18Karats will be too soft to hold on to the stones.</div>
